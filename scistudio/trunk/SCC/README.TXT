	This is an SCI Script Compiler. With it, you can write games 
for Sierra's Creative Interpreter, the engine used for such games as 
King's Quest, Quest for Glory, Leisure Suit Larry, Police Quest, and 
Space Quest.

	Use the project files in the machine directories (msdos, win32)
to compile. To create ports to other machines, create a source and
project file in a directory named after the machine. In the source 
file, include a main() and call CompileScript(char *FileName).
